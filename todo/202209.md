+ An OSF project for this lecture [pm5nh](https://osf.io/pm5nh/) can not give clear view after 12 weeks. Screenshot [osf-pm5nh-20220930-0314.png](img/osf-pm5nh-20220930-0314.png).
+ It is also not too easy to see the whole folder structure if you have already a lot of files. Screenshot [osf-pm5nh-20220930-0321.png](img/osf-pm5nh-20220930-0321.png).
+ OSF does have versioning feature. Screenshot [osf-rnqfw-20220930-0323.png](img/osf-rnqfw-20220930-0323.png).
+ Files will be archived per week. Each week in a seperate folder. At least there will be only 16 folders.
+ `0508` Finish moving files from OSF and use only the last version in GitHub. Next will be file name without version number since the previous version can be retrieved in history. :heavy_check_mark:
